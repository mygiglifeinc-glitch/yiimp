### Welcome to the cryptopool.builders github!
### This fork of YiiMP is designed to work with our Ultimate Crypto-Server Installer program.
Trying to install this on a server not built by our installer will cause headaches, frustrations, and screaming loudly at your monitor.

#### Please go to https://github.com/mygiglifeinc-glitch/Multi-Pool-Installer for our installer.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04 or 26.04 LTS (x86_64)
- PHP 8.1 or newer (the installer uses PHP 8.3); the bundled Yii framework is 1.1.32
- MariaDB 10.6 or newer
- Stratum build: `build-essential pkg-config libmysqlclient-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev`
  (`make -C stratum`, then `make -C stratum hashtest && stratum/hashtest` to check the hash functions)

### KawPoW family stratums

`kawpow` (RVN and forks), `evrprogpow` (EVR), `meowpow` (MEWC), `firopow` (FIRO), `sccpow` (SCC)
and `meraki` (TLS) use the KawPoW pool protocol (kawpowminer, T-Rex, NBMiner, TeamRedMiner...),
ports 9501-9506 in `stratum/config.sample`. No extra build dependency. Every stratum keeps the
light cache of the current and next epoch of each coin in memory (16 MB + 128 KB per epoch each: ~95 MB
for RVN or FIRO today, ~145 MB for MEWC) and verifies each share from it (~20 ms of CPU).
Share difficulty 1 is ~2^32 hashes, like a sha256 share: the algos need no web hashrate factor.

### Zcash family stratums

`equihash` (200,9: ZEC, KMD, ARRR...), `equihash144` (144,5: BTG, BTCZ, GLINK...) and
`equihash192` (192,7: YEC, ZCL, ZER...) use the ZIP-301 stratum of the Equihash miners (lolMiner,
GMiner, miniZ...), ports 9600-9602; `yespowerRES` (Resistance) uses the Bitcoin stratum of its
miner with a 140 byte header, port 9650. No extra build dependency. The Zcash daemons build the
coinbase (founders reward, funding streams...) and pay their `mineraddress` (zcashd) or a wallet
key; Bitcoin Gold needs segwit enabled on the coin. The Equihash parameters and the BLAKE2b
personalization can be set per stratum and per coin in the .conf (`equihash_n`, `equihash_k`,
`equihash_personalization`, `[EQUIHASH]` section), e.g. 48,5 for the zcashd regtest. Share
difficulty 1 is 8192 solutions (target 0x0007ffff..): the web hashrate constant of the equihash
algos is 2^23 (Sol/s) instead of 2^42.

Coins can be given their own stratum port with the *Dedicated Port* setting on the coin page;
the old `multi-port` branch is no longer needed.
